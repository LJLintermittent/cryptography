 "Audit guidelines for authorities to investigate the special audit" on August 1,
　　2001 implementation. In order to do a good job with the special audit investigation, the
　　special audit report prepared, the paper will try to write a special audit investigation
　　report (the report) to write data into analysis and editing the contents of the report, such
　　as a two-step; and then discuss the two-step method of writing; written methods to reveal
　　the main problems and propose solutions.
　　One or two notes
　　(A) audit institutions in society, as well as techniques for Writing little literature
　　that reports such as "the basic situation of" choice, "Proposal" and other references
　　related to the method of writing, there is no consensus. This stability, improve the level
　　of an impact report. In this paper targeted a number of techniques to explore issues.
　　(B) "analysis of written data" and "Edit the contents of the report" in the process of
　　report writing no clear boundaries. However, the impact of quality issues,无外乎"analysis"
　　and "edit" categories. To enable this paper to discuss the issue of system, location, easy
　　to understand and the only in this way.
　　Second, the process of data analysis methods and the existence of problems
　　(A) the process of data analysis
　　The process of data analysis report. The auditors verified the investigation of matters
　　of awareness, and ultimately form an audit opinion in the thinking process of the system.
　　Analysis and analysis of all aspects of the rules are as follows:
　　1, define the facts. Is a matter being investigated (or: the problem, the same below)
　　of the act and its related factors trajectory accurate and complete description. ①
　　trajectory behavior: including the time and place, people the way to quantify the content of
　　such range. ② event-related factors: including the quality of personnel, economic
　　environment, regulatory requirements, such as the application of non-quantifiable elements.
　　2, summed up the characteristics. Is a general problem (or non-expected issues, the
　　same below) existence of characteristics. Methods:
　　(1) the normative requirements (expected to state) and has completed the task of
　　defining the issues of non-expected (non-expected state), for "How should we (the expected
　　state)" and "how the actual (non-expected state)" comparison. (2) the difference will be
　　with them. (3) One of the most able to explain the general situation of non-existence of the
　　expected differences matter, that is, the characteristics of the matter.
　　For example, the purchase of raw materials close to the market price (the expected
　　state), but the purchase of long-haul and other high quality goods (non-expected state).
　　Characteristics of the matter can be summed up as lower prices of raw materials purchased.
　　3, look for the causes. Is to find unexpected events lead to specific issues.
　　Practices: (1) define the task has been completed and the matter of non-expected start with
　　the initial point. (2) may lead to unexpected behavior of the "event-related factors" out of
　　order. (3) One of the most reasonable interpretation of the matter of non-expected
　　"feature", and that the matter is the most likely cause.
　　4, infer trends. The development of the adverse trend of the development goals and the
　　corresponding scheme, or in terms of progress. Practices: (1) to determine the expected
　　trend with the non-corresponding to the current and expected future state. (2) define the
　　tasks have been completed by the non-expected current state of the matter, or derived
　　estimates of the adverse consequences that may arise. (3) the future state of the two (that
　　is, how should we and possible) with out the relevant factors. One of the biggest
　　differences in admission as a corollary.
　　5, to a conclusion. Concluded that by virtue of certain standards, the state of matters
　　being investigated, the nature of the evaluation, including the individual facts and
　　comprehensive evaluation of the two. (1) evaluation of the individual facts. The survey
　　project is the application of normative standards, and has completed the task of
　　investigating a matter of defining a comparison (quantitative comparison trajectory and
　　behavior standards, qualitative standards and event-related factors), from which the most
　　obvious differences, the most reasonable interpretation of the characteristics of the
　　factors that matter, as the evaluation findings. (2) a comprehensive evaluation. Survey
　　carried out on the overall evaluation. Approach: First of all, according to the survey
　　applies to comprehensive (eg, legal, benefits, etc.) standards, the task has been completed
　　to define the fact that the individual is classified collated and re-defined. Second, to
　　generalize the characteristics of different types of matters. Thirdly, the task has been
　　completed to define the overall integrated with the matter of a comprehensive evaluation of
　　the application of standards of comparison, take the most reasonable explanation can be
　　characterized by a synthesis factor, as the contents of the conclusions.
　　6, to make recommendations. Cure and control recommendations include two levels. For
　　"cause" of the proposal, you can fundamentally solve the "problem"; for "feature" of the
　　proposal, can play a control, to avoid loss, so that "problem" not to further expand the
　　role and even not occur. Because the inference drawn from the trend of adverse effects has
　　not yet formed, so the characteristics of the proposed problem will be able to play its role
　　in the control and prevention.
　　For example: four years of a state-owned enterprises to private enterprises to invest a
　　total of 100 million yuan, not investment income. (1) define: ① behavior trajectory: a
　　four-year investment to the private enterprise of many more than 100 million yuan, not
　　income. ② event-related factors: (see "possible causes") (2) features: a non-effective
　　investment. (3) possible causes: ① quickly to market changes. ② low level of decision-
　　making. ③ Management of the rule of law is not in place. Because changes in the market
　　fast, low levels of decision-making, can not be insisted on the grounds of non-performing
　　investments. Therefore, the management of the legal system in place, is the occurrence of
　　the non-effectiveness of investment most likely cause of the problem. (4) trend inferred:
　　that the past, the enterprise will be bankrupt. (5) Conclusion: (based on the principle of
　　the responsibility of preserving and increasing the value of assets) the responsible person
　　has lost a normal sense of responsibility. (6) recommendations for the selection: ① point
　　to Reason: In accordance with market economy values, the operation of state-owned assets
　　management responsibility of legislation. ② point features: carefully conducted survey on
　　the market; further strengthen the feasibility study; major decisions must be approved by
　　the board of directors vote; the establishment of direct and indirect responsibility for the
　　accountability system, and so on.
